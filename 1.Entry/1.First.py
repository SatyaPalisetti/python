##History of python
'''python is general purpose interpreted, interactive(way to run line by line and get immediate results), object oriented and high level programming language. Guido van rossum is known as the founder of python programming. It was created by Guido van rossum during 1985-1990.'''

##Features of python
'''
1.Easy to learn and use
2.interpreted language--executes code line by line without compiling it into machine code first
3.integrated---built in to the language itself
4.object oriented language--python revolves around structuring code using objects, which combine attributes and methods
5.Extensible--you can easily add new features to your python code by incorporating external writting code in other languages like c++
6.free and open source---anyone can download, use and modify the python programming language without paying any cost
7.GUI programming support---the language allows you to create graphical user interface for your applications,essentially letting you design interactive visual elements like buttons, text boxes, and menus
8.expressive language--the language allows you to write code that clearly and directlycommunicates the intended logic
9.large standard library--pre built functions and modules readily available to use
10.cross platform language---code written in python can run on different operating systems like windows,macos,and linuxnwithout nedding significant changes
