Relationship is used to access the members of one class inside another class.
The advantage of relationships is code reusability.
There are two types of relationsships.
1. Has-A Relationship( also known as Composition)
2. IS-A Relationship( also known as Inheritance)

#Examples:
'''
1. Employee HAS-A car
2. Employee IS-A Person
3. Car HAS-A Engine
4. Car IS-A Vehicle

#1. HAS-A Relationship
'''
HAS-A Relationship is also known as Composition or Containership or Complex Objects.
In HAS-A Relationship we will build objects from smaller objects.
Ex: College is complex object and departments are smaller objects.

Here without College(Container Object) there are no departments(Contained objects).
