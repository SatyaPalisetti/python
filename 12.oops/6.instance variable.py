##########Instance variable####################
'''
Instance variables are variables that belong to a specific instance (object) of a class.
'''
#Note:
'''
-If the values of the variable is differ then we can proceed with Instance variable like(Name and age)because they differ on every object. So,Instance variable is a object level variable.
-If the values of the variable is not differ then we can't use instance variable we can use only static variables like(school_name)
