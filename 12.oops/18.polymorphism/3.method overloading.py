###### Method Overloading ######
'''
-->If 2 or more methods have same name with different no of parameters of different type of parameters is called method overloading.
-->Python does not support method overloading. Other languages like java support it.
-->Because if we will define multiple methods then python will consider the last one only.
-->But indirectly we can archieve method overloading by using multiple dispatch decorator.
