##### Abstract Class and Abstract Method #####
'''
--->Partial Implementation of a class is called as abstract class.
--->Partial implementation means not complete implementation.
--->Abstract class is the blueprint for other classes.
--->Abstract class contain at least one abstract method.
--->Python doesn't provide support for abstract class, so we have to import a module named as abc module.
--->abc module stands for abstract base class.
--->Abstract class can also contain concreate method.
--->Abstract method means a method without having body part is called abstract method.
--->If we don't know the body part of a method then at that particular time we can define abstract method.
--->By using @abstractmethod decorator we can abstract method.
--->Child class will provide the body part of abstract method.
--->We can create the object of a abstract class. 
--->If a method have body part then that method is called as concreate method.
