##datatype
'''Python Data types are the classification  of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. Since everything is an object in Python programming, Python data types are classes and variables are instances (objects) of these classes.
every variable has a data type .data types specifizes size and type of values that can be stored.

##pyhon data types
'''1.immutable--we cannot change the values after creation of process
2.mutable---we can change the values after creation of process'''

#1.Immutable
'''
1.Number
       1.int 2.float 3.complex 
2.strings---String is a collection of characters like(A-Z)(a-z)(0-9)(special symbols). 
 
3.tuples----it is similar to list. The difference between two is that we cannot change the elements of a tuple once it is assigned where we can change the elements of a list. Tuple with ( ) brackets.
'''
#2.Mutable
'''
1.lists---- list is a collection of elements with various data types. List with [] brackets
2.dictioneries---by using list,tuple ,set we can store only values.sometimes as a programmer we require to key and values as a pair in that case we can go to dictionary. dict is unordered,mutable and indexed by keys
3.sets----set is a collection of elements with various datatypes. set is mutable(we can change) and its elements are immutable(We can't change). set cannot accept duplicate elements. set cannot follow order. set with { } brackets.
